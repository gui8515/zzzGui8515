	description = Hello, my name is Orville Kerman, and I and my brother founded Wright Aeronautical. We started out with a bicycle company but have only recently begun exploring the area of aerodynamics. We have recently developed an engine that is light enough to mount onto a flying machine!&br;&br;You may purchase the following production-ready prototype part that will allow you to start making flying machines:&br;&br;- FTX-2 External Fuel Duct
	
	synopsis = Flight engine technology is at your fingertips! Simply cover the cost of our initial production run, and this prototype part will be yours! 
	
	notes = The part will be available immediately to your organization upon contract acceptance.
	
	completedMessage = Part transfer complete.&br;&br;Your organization now has access to the following:&br;&br;- FTX-2 External Fuel Duct&br;&br;Enjoy the new part!
