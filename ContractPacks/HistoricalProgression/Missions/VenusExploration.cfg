The probe appeared to go silent on impact but recording tapes kept rolling. A few weeks later, upon a review of the tapes, another 23 minutes of very weak signals were found on them. The spacecraft had landed on Venus and probably bounced onto its side, leaving the medium gain antenna not aimed correctly for strong signal transmission to Earth. \n\nThe probe transmitted information to Earth for 53 minutes, which included 20 minutes from the surface. It was found that the temperature at the surface of Venus was 475 °C (887 °F) ° ± 20 ° C and the pressure was 90 ± 15 atmospheres. The pressure corresponded to approximately 900 m below sea level. The probe provided information about the surface of Venus, which could not be seen through a thick veil of atmosphere. The spacecraft definitively confirmed that on the surface of Venus man is not able to survive and excluded the possibility that there is any liquid water on Venus.
