    description = Sputnik 2 was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit, and the first to carry a living animal, a dog named Laika. Sputnik 2 was a 4-meter (13 foot) high cone-shaped capsule with a base diameter of 2 meters (6.6 feet) that weighed around 500 kg, though it was not designed to separate from the rocket core that brought it to orbit, bringing the total mass in orbit to 7.79 tons.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Sputnik 2 was the second artificial satellite of Earth as well as the first launched with a living creature, the dog Laika.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> November 3, 1957
		
    completedMessage = Success! Sputnik 2 was a follow up onto Sputnik 1 and the first to orbit Earth with a living creature aboard, however the dog Laika is believed to have died only a few hours after orbit.

    description = Explorer 1 was the first satellite of the United States, launched as part of its participation in the International Geophysical Year. The mission followed the first two satellites the previous year; the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 and 2, beginning the Cold War Space Race between the two nations.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Explorer 1 was the first satellite launched by the Americans. It contained more science instruments than the previous Sputnik launches.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> January 31, 1958
	
    completedMessage = Mission Success! Explorer 1 was launched on January 31, 1958 at 22:48 Eastern Time atop the first Juno booster from LC-26 at the Cape Canaveral Missile Annex, Florida. It was the first spacecraft to detect the Van Allen radiation belt, returning data until its batteries were exhausted after nearly four months. It remained in orbit until 1970, and has been followed by more than 90 scientific spacecraft in the Explorer series.

    description = Explorer 6, or S-2, was an American satellite. It was a small, spheroidal satellite designed to study trapped radiation of various energies, galactic cosmic rays, geomagnetism, radio propagation in the upper atmosphere, and the flux of micrometeorites. It also tested a scanning device designed for photographing the Earth's cloud cover, and transmitted the first pictures of Earth from orbit.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Explorer 6 transmitted the first images of Earth while in orbit.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> August 7, 1959
	
    completedMessage = Mission Success! Explorer 6 was launched into a highly elliptical orbit and returned the first images of Earth from space.
