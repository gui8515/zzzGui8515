	description = Soyuz 9 was a 1970 Soviet manned space flight. The two-man crew of Andrian Nikolayev and Vitali Sevastyanov broke the five-year-old space endurance record held by Gemini 7, with their nearly 18-day flight. It was also the last flight of the first-generation Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft, as well as the first manned space launch to be conducted at night. To date, Soyuz 9 marks the longest manned flight by a solo spacecraft.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Soyuz 9 set a new record for duration in space and still holds the record for the longest manned flight by a solo spacecraft.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> June 1, 1970

	description = The Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), conducted in July 1975, was the first joint U.S.–Soviet space flight, as a symbol of the policy of détente that the two superpowers were pursuing at the time. It involved the docking of an Apollo Command/Service Module with the Soviet Soyuz 19. The unnumbered Apollo vehicle was a surplus from the terminated Apollo program and the last one to fly. This mission ceremoniously marked the end of the Space Race that had begun in 1957 with the Sputnik launch.\n\n Significance:\n Salyut 1 was the first designed Space Station and the Soyuz 11 crew set new duration records staying on the station for 22 days.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> April 19, 1971
		
	synopsis = Launch Soyuz and Apollo and dock them together to improve international cooperation
	notes = Launch Soyuz and Apollo and dock them together to improve international cooperation
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations, this is a historic step towards future joint space missions and cooperation! While the two ships were docked, the three Americans and two Soviets conducted joint scientific experiments, exchanged flags and gifts (including tree seeds which were later planted in the two countries), signed certificates, visited each other's ships, ate together, and conversed in each other's languages. There were also docking and redocking maneuvers, during which the two spacecraft reversed roles and the Soyuz became the "active" ship.\n\nAfter 44 hours together, the two ships separated, and maneuvered to use the Apollo to create an artificial solar eclipse to allow the crew of the Soyuz to take photographs of the solar corona. Another brief docking was made before the ships went their separate ways. The Soviets remained in space for five days, and the Americans for nine, during which the Apollo crew also conducted Earth observation experiments.

    title = Helios
	agent = DFVLR
	
	sortKey = 336
    
	description = Helios-A and Helios-B, were a pair of probes launched into heliocentric orbit for the purpose of studying solar processes. A joint venture of West Germany's space agency DFVLR and NASA, the probes were launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Dec. 10, 1974, and Jan. 15, 1976, respectively. Built by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm as the main contractor they were the first spaceprobes built outside the United States or Soviet Union. The probes are notable for having set a maximum speed record among spacecraft at 252,792 km/h. Helios 2 flew three million kilometers closer to the Sun than Helios 1, achieving perihelion on 17 April 1976 at a record distance of 0.29 AU (or 43.432 million kilometers), slightly inside the orbit of Mercury. Helios 2 was sent into orbit 13 months after the launch of Helios 1. The Helios space probes completed their primary missions by the early 1980s, but they continued to send data up to 1985. The probes are no longer functional but still remain in their elliptical orbit around the Sun.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> The Helios probes traveled closer to the Sun than any other spacecraft.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> December 10, 1974
    
	synopsis = Launch Helios and Orbit the Sun and Transmit Science Data
	notes = Launch Helios and Orbit the Sun and Transmit Science Data
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations! Both probes were collected important data about the processes that cause the solar wind and the acceleration of the particles that make up the interplanetary medium and cosmic rays. These observations were made, both the minimum solar cycle (1976) and at its peak in the early 1970s. The observation of the zodiacal light has established some of the dust properties interplanetary present between 0.1 AU and 1 AU from the Sun, as their spatial distribution, color and polarization. It has been established that the powder was more sensitive to gravitational forces and electromagnetic forces. The amount of dust was observed up to 10 times around the Earth. heterogeneous distribution was generally expected due to the passage of comets, but observations have not confirmed this. The probe instruments detected dust near the sun showing that, despite the sunshine is still present in distance 0.09 AU.
