	description = The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous – Shoemaker (NEAR Shoemaker), renamed after its 1996 launch in honor of planetary scientist Eugene Shoemaker, was a robotic space probe designed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for NASA to study the near-Earth asteroid Eros from close orbit over a period of a year. The mission succeeded in closing in with the asteroid and orbited it several times, finally terminating by touching down on the asteroid on February 12, 2001.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> NEAR Shoemaker was the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid (not possible in KSP) and the first to land on an asteroid.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> February 17, 1996

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The primary goal of the mission was to study the near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros from orbit for approximately one year. Eros is an S-type asteroid approximately 13 × 13 × 33 km in size, the second largest near-Earth asteroid. Initially the orbit was circular with a radius of 200 km. The radius of the orbit was brought down in stages to a 50 × 50 km orbit on 30 April 2000 and decreased to 35 × 35 km on July 14, 2000. The orbit was raised over succeeding months to a 200 × 200 km orbit and then slowly decreased and altered to a 35 × 35 km retrograde orbit on December 13, 2000. The mission ended with a touchdown in the "saddle" region of Eros on February 12, 2001.

	description =  Cassini–Huygens is an unmanned spacecraft sent to the planet Saturn. Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2016. It has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004. Huygens is a probe that was designed to land on Saturn's moon Titan.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Cassini-Huygens was the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Saturn and to land on the moon Titan.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> October 15, 1997
		
	synopsis = Design the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft to reach @targetBody
	notes = Design the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft to reach @targetBody
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations on the successful mission! The spacecraft launched on October 15, 1997 aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur and entered orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004, after an interplanetary voyage that included flybys of Earth, Venus, and Jupiter. On December 25, 2004, Huygens separated from the orbiter and reached Saturn's moon Titan on January 14, 2005. It entered Titan's atmosphere and descended to the surface. It successfully returned data to Earth, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System.
