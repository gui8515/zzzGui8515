The three cosmonauts became the 15th resident crew of the MIR. The crew did research work in space flight medicine, primarily by cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov during his long-term flight, and accomplished 25 different experiments. Polyakov lived on Mir for 437 days and holds the record for the longest human space flight.\n\n Significance:\n Soyuz TM-18 brought Valeri Polyakov to the Mir Space Station where he lived for 437 days.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> January 9, 1994

	completedMessage = Congratulations! There will be a lot of information learned from the long term habitation in space! Polyakov underwent medical assessments before, during, and after the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. When researchers compared the results of these medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return to Earth.[6][7] However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.

	sortKey = 461
	
	description = Spektr was the first of the three modules launched during the Shuttle-Mir programme; it served as the living quarters for American astronauts and housed NASA-sponsored experiments. The module was designed for remote observation of Earth's environment and contained atmospheric and surface research equipment. Additionally, it featured four solar arrays which generated approximately half of the station's electrical power. The module also featured a science airlock to expose experiments to the vacuum of space selectively. Spektr was rendered unusable following the collision with Progress M-34 in 1997 which damaged the module, exposing it directly to the vacuum of space.\n\n Significance:\n Kristall was the fourth module to be attached to the Mir Space Station\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> May 20, 1995
		
	synopsis = Launch the Spektr module and dock with Mir
	notes = Launch the Spektr module and dock with Mir
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations, the Mir Space Station has grown in size again! Spektr provided a much needed increase in the amount of power generated by the station.\n\nOn June 25, 1997, the Progress M-34 spacecraft crashed into Spektr while doing an experimental docking maneuver with the Kvant-1 module. The collision damaged one of Spektr's solar arrays and punctured the hull, causing a relatively slow leak. The crew had enough time to install a hatch cover and seal the module off to prevent depressurization of the entire Mir station. To seal the module, the crew had to remove the cables that were routed through the (open) hatchway, including the power cables from Spektr's solar panels.\n\nAn internal spacewalk in the Spektr module in August 1997 by cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and Pavel Vinogradov, from Soyuz TM-26, succeeded in restoring these power connections by installing a modified hatch cover to allow the power cables to pass through the hatch when it was in the closed position. In a second internal spacewalk in October they connected two of the panels to a computer system to allow the panels to be controlled remotely and align with the Sun. These modifications allowed power generation to return to approximately 70% of the pre-collision generation capability.\n\nSpektr was left depressurized and isolated from the remainder of the Mir complex.

Together the shuttle and station crews conducted various on-orbit joint US/Russian life science investigations with Spacelab along with the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment-II (SAREX-II) experiment.

Further commercially funded missions beyond Soyuz TM-30 were originally planned to continue the restoration efforts of the then 14-year-old space station, but insufficient funding and investment ultimately led to the de-orbit of the station in early 2001.

	description = The deorbit of Mir was the controlled atmospheric re-entry of the modular Russian space station Mir carried out on March 23, 2001. Major components ranged from about 5 to 15 years in age, and included the Mir Core Module, Kvant-1, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr, Priroda, and Docking Module. Although Russia was optimistic about Mir's future, the country's commitments to the International Space Station project left no funding to support Mir.\n\n Significance:\n The deorbiting of Mir ended the era of the first modular Space Station.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> March 23, 2001

Mir set many firsts in space and proved that long-term, modular space stations were possible. The future looks bright with the ongoing construction of the International Space Station and we are excited to move onto the next phase of space habitation.\n\nThe deorbit was carried out in three stages. The first stage was waiting for atmospheric drag to decay the orbit an average of 220 km (137 mi). This began with the docking of Progress M1-5. The second stage was the transfer of the station into a 165 × 220 km (103 × 137 mi) orbit. This was achieved with two burns of the Progress M1-5's control engines at 00:32 UTC and 02:01 UTC on March 23, 2001. After a two-orbit pause, the third and final stage of Mir's deorbit began with the firing of Progress M1-5's control engines and main engine at 05:08 UTC, lasting a little over 22 minutes. The atmospheric re-entry at the altitude of 100 km (62 mi) occurred at 05:44 UTC near Nadi, Fiji.
