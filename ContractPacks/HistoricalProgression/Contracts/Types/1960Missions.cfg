The Vostok 3KA space capsule was launched on April 12, 1961 from Baikonur Cosmodrome with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, making him the first human to cross into outer space. The orbital spaceflight consisted of a single orbit around Earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at 169 kilometers (91 nautical miles) at its lowest point. The flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing. Gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at 7 km (23,000 ft) altitude.\n\n Significance:\n Vostok 1 was the first manned Spaceflight\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> April 12, 1961

Four decades after the flight, historian Asif Azam Siddiqi wrote that Vostok 1: "will undoubtedly remain one of the major milestones in not only the history of space exploration, but also the history of the human race itself. The fact that this accomplishment was successfully carried out by the Soviet Union, a country completely devastated by war just sixteen years prior, makes the achievement even more impressive. Unlike the United States, the USSR had to begin from a position of tremendous disadvantage. Its industrial infrastructure had been ruined, and its technological capabilities were outdated at best. A good portion of its land had been devastated by war, and it had lost about 25 million citizens ... but it was the totalitarian state that overwhelmingly took the lead [in the space race]."

It was the first manned flight of Project Mercury, the objective of which was to put an astronaut into orbit around the Earth and return him safely. Shepard named his capsule Freedom 7, setting a precedent for the remaining six Mercury astronauts naming their spacecraft. The number 7 was included in the spacecraft name to honor NASA's first group of seven astronauts.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Mercury-Redstone 3: Freedom 7 was the first Manned Suborbital Flight\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> May 5, 1961

Alan Shepard's mission was a 15-minute suborbital flight which reached an altitude of 101.2 nautical miles (187.5 kilometers) and traveled a downrange distance of 263.1 nautical miles (487.3 kilometers). It was the third Mercury flight launched with the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, close to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nDuring the flight, Shepard observed the Earth and tested the capsule's attitude control system, turning the capsule around to face its blunt heat shield forward for atmospheric entry. He also tested the retrorockets which would return later missions from orbit, though the capsule did not have enough energy to remain in orbit. After re-entry, the capsule landed by parachute on the Atlantic ocean off the Bahamas. Shepard and the capsule were picked up by helicopter and brought to an aircraft carrier.\n\nThe mission was a technical success, though American pride in the accomplishment was dampened by the fact that just 3 weeks before, the Soviet Union had launched the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, who completed one orbit on Vostok 1.

Unlike Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1, Titov took manual control of the spacecraft for a short while.

	description = Syncom 3 was the first geostationary satellite. (The earlier geosynchronous Syncom 2 had an orbit inclined to the equator.) It was an experimental geosynchronous communications satellite placed over the equator at 180 degrees longitude in the Pacific Ocean. The satellite provided live television coverage of the 1964 Olympic games in Tokyo, Japan and conducted various communications tests. Operations were turned over to the Department of Defense on 1 January 1965, Syncom 3 was to prove useful in the DoD's Vietnam communications.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Syncom 3 was the first satellite to achieve Geostationary Orbit\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> August 19, 1964

	description = Voskhod 2 was launched with two men on board, cosmonauts Pavel I. Belyayev, pilot, and Aleksey A. Leonov, co-pilot. The spacecraft was equipped with an extendable air lock that permitted Leonov's exit into space without having to evacuate the main cabin air. Leonov was the first man to perform an EVA (ExtraVehicular Activity) in space.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Voskhod 2 was the first time a person left the capsule to perform an EVA\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> March 18, 1965

	completedMessage = Congratulations! For this EVA a space suit was donned, and a life-support system was worn in a back pack. The EVA was recorded by a mounted extended TV camera. Leonov also carried a handheld movie camera. The EVA lasted 20 min, during which Leonov experienced tension and euphoria. The flight of Voskhod 2 lasted for 26 hr, and 16 orbits were completed. A manually controlled reentry was performed because of a malfunction of the automatic orientation devices for the retrofire, and the spacecraft landed in a pine forest far north of the target area. After locating the spacecraft, one day was required to cut through the forest and bring the crew out on skis.
