This early in our space program, we are still trying to see how far and how high we can launch rockets.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> These are the first launches of rockets that would help us to refine our rocketry techniques to go higher, faster and farther.

    description = The V-2, technical name Aggregat-4 (A-4), was the world's first long-range guided ballistic missile. The missile with a liquid-propellant rocket engine was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a "vengeance weapon," designed to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities. The V-2 rocket also became the first artificial object to cross the boundary of space with the vertical launch of V-177 on 20 June 1944.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> The V-2, or A-4 was the first man made object to cross the Karman line and reach space. This early rocket was the basis of the rockets developed in both the USSR and USA that would. After WWII, the German scientists that worked on the project helped to develop the technology in both countries.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> June 20, 1944
    
	completedMessage = Success! The V-2 Rocket, and the German scientists working on it, became the foundation of the rocketry programs in both the USSR and USA.

    description = The Sputnik 1 spacecraft was the first artificial satellite successfully placed in orbit around the Earth and was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome at Tyuratam in Kazakhstan, then part of the former Soviet Union. The Russian word "Sputnik" means "companion" ("satellite" in the astronomical sense).\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite orbiting Earth.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> October 4, 1957
		
    completedMessage = Success! Sputnik 1 is one of the most significant events of the Space Race between the USA and USSR. This monumental achievement was proof of how far ahead the USSR were at this point in history. The fact that the satellite was orbiting above the Earth terrified people in the United States as many thought the Soviets could drop a bomb from something similar.

    description = Vanguard 1 was the fourth artificial Earth orbital satellite launched (after Sputnik 1, Sputnik 2, and Explorer 1). It was the first satellite to be solar powered.\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> Vanguard 1 was the first satellite that had solar panels on it.

    completedMessage = Although communication with it was lost in 1964, it remains the oldest manmade satellite still in orbit. Vanguard 1 was described by then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as, "The grapefruit satellite."
