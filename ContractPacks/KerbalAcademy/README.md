Kerbal Academy Contract Pack for use with Contract Configurator by nightingale.
Credit severedsolo for orginal concept and creation of Kerbal Academy up to version 1.1.8  
Credit nightingale for Contract Configurator which is a dependecy for this contract pack. (Go give him some respect)
Credit Mark-Kerbin for versions 1.1.9 onward. This includes bugfixing and updating orginal work by severedsolo, and the creation and mantinance of additonal work by Mark-kerbin.

Updates and Issues;
Mark-Kerbin would appreciate being notified of potential issues with Kerbal Academy Contracts, and anything contained in the Kerbal Academy folder. Please file a issue report on Kerbal Academy's Github Repo.

This Contract Pack will likely function as intended past the version of KSP it was released for so long as Contract Configurator is up to date. This does not mean it will function as intended, and does not mean that Mark-Kerbin will supply an updated version quickly.   

Installation;
Check https://github.com/Mark-Kerbin/Kerbal-Academy-Contract-Pack/releases for new releases past version 1.1.8
Legacy versions can be found at https://github.com/severedsolo/KerbalAcademy/releases (Versions before 1.1.8)

Place the contents of the GameData folder in your KSP/GameData folder
