Updates and Issues;
Mark-Kerbin would appreciate being notified of potential issues with Kerbal Academy Contracts, and anything contained in the Kerbal Academy folder. Please file a issue report on Kerbal Academy's Github Repo.

This Contract Pack will likely function as intended past the version of KSP it was released for so long as Contract Configurator is up to date. This does not mean it will function as intended, and does not mean that Mark-Kerbin will supply an updated version quickly.   

Installation;
Check https://github.com/Mark-Kerbin/Kerbal-Academy-Contract-Pack/releases for new releases past version 1.1.8
Legacy versions can be found at https://github.com/severedsolo/KerbalAcademy/releases (Versions before 1.1.8)

Place the contents of the GameData folder in your KSP/GameData folder

Kerbal Space Program\GameData\ContractPacks\KerbalAcademy
