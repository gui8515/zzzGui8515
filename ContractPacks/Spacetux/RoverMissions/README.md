# RoverContracts

This mod was originally released by whyren.

He hasn't been doing anything with it, and I wanted to expand it.

The following is his original text:

    Here is an Opportunity to seize the Spirit of rovers! Have I piqued your 
    Curiosity? YuTu can send manned and unmanned rovers across the system and 
    run them for years beyond their intended life span until the wheels crumble!

    This contract pack offers two new missions: 
    1. Rover Deployment: encourages you to send rovers to planets/moons where 
       you don't have them. 
    2. Rover Expedition: Detects a location near your rover and requests whatever 
       scientific experiments the rover is equipped with be completed at that 
       location. The more capable the rover, the greater the returns. Take the 
       mission as often as you want and enjoy the challenge and immersion of 
       navigating and studying alien terrain!

    Requires Contract Configurator 1.5.3 or newer. 
    Waypoint Manager is HIGHLY recommended.
    
    THANK YOU, nightingale, for your tireless work and patient help.

The Rover Expedition has now been expanded with up to 5 waypoints which you have i
to visit.  And you don't know where they are until you are on the mission.

There will soon be more science as well.  As I get more science experiments listed,
I'll release new versions
