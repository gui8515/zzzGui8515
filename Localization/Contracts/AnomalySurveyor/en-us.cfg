		#LOC_ZZZGUI8515_Contract_Kerbin_Monolith_Description = Linus has been complaining that his Tycho brand gyroscopes have been behaving oddly for weeks.

		#LOC_ZZZGUI8515_Contract_Kerbin_Monolith_Additional_Description = After visiting the Tycho Magnetic Anomaly (now known as TMA-0), it started to send signals out in several directions. We could tell the signals were going through the planet, and have been able to calculate where on the surface the signals lead to. These spots have been marked as TMA-1 through TMA-4. We need to see where the signals lead.
