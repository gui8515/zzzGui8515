		//PART DESCRIPTIONS
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_001 = The Aerocam is a gutted KerbPro in an aerodynamic case. Now the KerbPro won't be a drag on your vessel. This version has it's CCD flipped. Now you wont have the feelling you are hanging upside down underneath a horizontal craft.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_002 = The Aerocam is a gutted KerbPro in an aerodynamic case. Now the KerbPro won't be a drag on your vessel.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_003 = The BoosterCam packs two cameras in one discrete, streamlined package. Provides no science value, but useful for piloting.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_004 = A classic multipurpose black and white camera.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_005 = This camera might be on the heavy side, but it packs a decent zoom. And, more importantly, it's blast-proof so it will survive all of your rocket launch failures.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_006 = The picture quality isn't great, but this tiny lightweight camera is perfect for piloting rovers and probes.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_007 = This camera is capable of night vision, not useful on a sunny day.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_008 = This camera is mainly geared for scientific research, but it makes a great all-around camera.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_009 = This camera is made for wide angle views.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_010 = A standard camera made out high grade cardboard and ducktape.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_011 = The KerbPro is an extremely durable camera primarily used in various sporting activities. Kerbal Space Program asked if these were durable enough to be used as rocket cams. Only time will tell.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_012 = Jeb was fiddling around with the camera one day when he "accidentally" bumped a lever labeled DO NOT TOUCH. Following some alarmingly zoomed in pictures of Bill's panicked eyes, they decided this could be strapped to the front of a rocket for a telescope, too.
		#autoLOC_HULL_DESC_013 = After Jeb received a formal reprimand for his cavalier behavior (he was not given a juice box at lunch time), the engineers have designed a more modular and stable telescope to inspect kerbonauts crew cuts for consistency and fleas.
